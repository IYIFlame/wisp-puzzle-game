# wisp-puzzle-game
3d third person puzzle solving game. Developed in JavaScript using Unity 5.
The goal of the game is to solve all the puzzles and reach the end indicated by a yellow face.

!!!IMPORTANT!!!
in the GameProject_Data folder there is a .7z file called sharedassets0.7z. Make sure you extract its contents in the same folder before attempting to run the game. The file had to be archived due to its large size which caused troubles when uploading.
!!!IMPORTANT!!!

Developed as a self-proposed honours project for university this is a puzzle solving game inspired by some of my favourite games such as Portal, Guild Wars 2, Warcraft and more. This is the first game I completely designed and implemented on my own. I have also included my university report for anyone interested in the process.

To start the game double click on GameProject.exe, select your graphics settings and click Play!. If the game stutters try lowering the graphics settings. It should run OK on i5-2320, gtx 555, 8gb ram machine.
